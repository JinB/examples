# High-Performance Wikipedia Search and Analysis Tool

## The task

Construct a minimalistic, single-page React application that searches and presents Wikipedia results emphasizing swift performance and secure interactions. Keep track of the search history for each user. Create a minimalist responsive user interface with visual feedback during data fetching.

Requirements: Develop a Node.js server to manage Wikipedia API interactions from multiple users and utilize React hooks for frontend state control.

## The solution

Frontend: Re–∞ct v18.2.0, backend: Node v21.6.0

React hooks utilized: useReducer, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo

Performance is optimized by debouncing during typing, with fast suggestions of the ten first hits. Full-text search returns the first 500 results displayed in a virtualized list. The application is compiled with optimization provided by Vite, and the search history for each user is kept in the state.

The application was developed by Eugenio Besson. Feel free to provide your feedback or suggest any improvements.
